## Problem Statement
- Rescue First: Enhanced Digital Forms Management for Animal Care
Nature's Edge Wildlife and Reptile Rescue faced challenges with manual processes for animal intake and adoption, making it difficult to manage and access vital information. We created a user-friendly digital forms management system that allows for easy access, completion, and storage of forms, with the capability to generate unique URLs for sharing. The platform features a straightforward interface for non-technical users and comprehensive search functionality to quickly retrieve specific animal information and completed forms. Additionally, we set up a cloud-based donation management profile using GiveButter to automate donation tracking and streamline administrative tasks. This scalable solution enhances operational efficiency and improves animal care management.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, CSS Frameworks
- Backend: JavaScript, ExpressJS
- Database: SQLite

## Instruction to set up and run the current project
- Notice: To run this application, it is required to have both the front-end and the back-end running the same time.
1. Open the terminal and clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/2024-Arizona-Opportunity-Hack/Yellow-Brown-Bananas-Nature-sEdgeWildlife-Nature-sEdgeWildlifeandReptileRescueDigitalTransformation`.
2. Split the terminal into two halves: one for front-end and one for back-end.
3. `cd frontend` in the terminal for frontend; `cd backend` in the terminal for the backend.
4. `npm install` in BOTH terminals to install the necessary packages for the starting process.
5. `npm start` in BOTH terminals. The frontend page will automatically be opened at `locolhost:3000` - which you can use the functionalies to our app. Our backend is ran in `locolhost:8000` to host the services that the frontend is using.
