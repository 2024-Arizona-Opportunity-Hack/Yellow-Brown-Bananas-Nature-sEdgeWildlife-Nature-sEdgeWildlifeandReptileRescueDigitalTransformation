## Problem Statement
- Rescue First: Enhanced Digital Forms Management for Animal Care
Nature's Edge Wildlife and Reptile Rescue faced challenges with manual processes for animal intake and adoption, making it difficult to manage and access vital information. We created a user-friendly digital forms management system that allows for easy access, completion, and storage of forms, with the capability to generate unique URLs for sharing. The platform features a straightforward interface for non-technical users and comprehensive search functionality to quickly retrieve specific animal information and completed forms. Additionally, we set up a cloud-based donation management profile using GiveButter to automate donation tracking and streamline administrative tasks. This scalable solution enhances operational efficiency and improves animal care management.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js, Node.js, JavaScript, CSS Frameworks
- Backend: JavaScript
- Database: SQLite
